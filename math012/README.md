# Problem No. 12

The sequence of tiangle numbers is generated by adding the natural numbers. So the 7th triangle number would be 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 + 7 = 28.
The first ten terms are:

```
1, 3, 6, 10, 15, 21, 28, 36, 45, 55...
```

Let us list the factors of the first seven triangle numbers:

```
 1: 1
 3: 1, 3
 6: 1, 2, 3, 6
10: 1, 2, 5, 10
15: 1, 3, 5, 15
21: 1, 3, 7, 21
28: 1, 2, 4, 7, 14, 28
```

We can see that 28 is the first triangle number to have over five divisors.

## Part A

What is the value of the first triangle number to have over five hundred divisors?

Edit the file answer.py and update the function `answer()` to return the answer.

## Part B

Write a function in python that returns the first (smallest) triangle number to have over n divisors.

```python
solver(n: int = None)
```
