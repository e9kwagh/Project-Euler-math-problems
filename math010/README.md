# Problem No. 10

The sum of the primes below 10 is 2 + 3 + 5 + 7 = 17.

## Part A

Find the sum of the primes below two million.

Edit the file answer.py and update the function `answer()` to return the answer.

## Part B

Write a function in python that returns the sum of all prime numbers.

Solve for the range all numbers less than or equal to `p` if only `p` is provided

Solve for the range between `p` and `q` if `p` and `q` are both provided

The function should return `None` if the inputs are invalid

```python
solver(p: int, q: int = None)
```

```python
In [1]: solver(10)
Out[1]: 17
```
