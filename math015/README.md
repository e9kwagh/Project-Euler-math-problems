## Lattice Paths

Starting in the top left corner of a $2 \times 2$ grid, and only being able to move to the right and down, there are exactly $6$ routes to the bottom right corner.

## Part A

How many such routes are there through a $20 \times 20$ grid?

Edit the file answer.py and update the function `answer()` to return the answer.

## Part B

Generalize the solution in Part A for a $n \times m$ sized grid.

```python
solver()
```
